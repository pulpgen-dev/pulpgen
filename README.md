# ðŸ“š pulpgen: Your Ghostwriter in the Machine - An AI Novel Drafting Agent


---

**What is it?** `pulpgen` is a command-line tool that uses AI (Google Gemini) to automatically write a complete first-draft novel based on your idea/prompt. It handles outlining, chapter writing, and interactive AI-assisted editing.

## âš¡ Quick Start

1.  **Install:** Requires Python 3.13+ and `uv`.
    ```bash
    # Clone or download the code first
    cd pulpgen
    uv sync
    ```
2.  **API Key:** Create a `.env` file in the `pulpgen` directory with `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
3.  
    ```bash
    # Example using a prompt file:
    uv run python pulpgen.py --prompt your_idea.txt
    # Or run without --prompt to enter idea interactively
    ```
    API Key can be created in Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
4.  **Run (Resume Project):**
    ```bash
    uv run python pulpgen.py --resume path/to/your/project_folder
    ```
5.  **Output:** Finds/creates a project folder (like `YYYYMMDD-slug-uuid`) containing XML state files and the final manuscript in `final.html`.

## Usage

Launch the `pulpgen` agent from your terminal within the project directory:

```bash
uv run python pulpgen.py [OPTIONS]
```

**Command-Line Options:**

*   `--resume FOLDER_PATH`: Point to an existing project folder (e.g., `20240315-space-opera-saga-f3a4b1c9`) to continue a previously started job.
*   `--prompt FILE_PATH`: Provide the path to a `.txt` file containing your book idea. This is only used when starting a *new* project (ignored if `--resume` is used).

## Project Files

`pulpgen` keeps its work organized in a dedicated project folder (e.g., `20240315-robot-romance-a1b2c3d4`):

*   **`YYYYMMDD-slug-uuid/` (Project Folder):** The main case file, named with the date, a slugified title, and a unique ID.
*   **`outline.xml`:** The initial blueprint. Contains metadata (title, synopsis, your idea), character profiles, and chapter summaries generated in Phase 1. This is the starting map.
*   **`patch-NN.xml`:** Sequential dispatch logs. Each patch records a chunk of generated chapter content (Phase 2) or the results of an editing action (Phase 3). When resuming, `pulpgen` replays these patches to reconstruct the story's current state. Essential for tracking the narrative's evolution. `NN` is a zero-padded number (e.g., `patch-01.xml`, `patch-02.xml`).
*   **`final.xml`:** The consolidated, complete manuscript draft produced at the very end of the process. Contains everything from the outline and all applied patches.
*   **`final.html`:** A clean, readable HTML version of the final draft, suitable for reading or importing elsewhere.
*   **`version-NN.html`:** HTML snapshots generated after each *content generation* or *editing* patch (`patch-NN.xml`) is saved. Allows you to review the draft at intermediate stages.
*   **`latest.html`:** Always points to the HTML version of the *most recent* state (updated after every patch save). Useful for quick reviews during the process.

## The Assembly Line: From Spark to Manuscript

Once you kick off a new project, `pulpgen` works autonomously through these phases:

**Phase 1: Outline Generation**

*   **Agent Action:** Takes your initial idea and target chapter count. Instructs the AI to flesh out:
    *   A compelling title and synopsis.
    *   A cast of characters (`<characters>`) with names and brief descriptions.
    *   Detailed summaries for each chapter (`<chapters>`), outlining the plot progression.
*   **Output:** Saves the complete structure to `outline.xml`. The patch counter is reset to 0.

**Phase 2: Content Drafting**

*   **Agent Action:** Systematically works through the `outline.xml`. Selects batches of chapters needing content (using a spread/fill strategy to provide context). Instructs the AI to write the full prose for each selected chapter, guided by its summary and the overall narrative context.
*   **Output:** Saves generated chapter content in sequential `patch-NN.xml` files. Updates `version-NN.html` and `latest.html` after each patch.

**Phase 3: Interactive Revision & Refinement**

*   **Agent Action:** This is where you step back in! `pulpgen` presents an interactive menu with powerful editing tools that leverage the AI:
    *   **Make Chapter(s) Longer:** Select chapters and specify a target word count; the AI rewrites them to be more expansive.
    *   **Rewrite Chapter (with instructions):** Choose a chapter and provide specific instructions; the AI rewrites its content based on your direction, keeping the original summary.
    *   **Rewrite Chapter (Fresh Rewrite):** Similar to above, but the AI is *not* shown the chapter's *current* content (only the summary and context), encouraging a completely fresh take based on your instructions.
    *   **Ask LLM for Edit Suggestions:** The AI analyzes the *entire* current draft and provides a numbered list of potential improvements (pacing, character arcs, consistency, etc.). You can then choose one suggestion for the AI to attempt implementing via a patch.
    *   **General Edit Request (LLM Patch):** Provide broad instructions (e.g., "Improve dialogue in Act 2", "Check for plot holes related to the MacGuffin"). The AI analyzes the draft and generates a patch file attempting to address your request.
*   **User Interaction:** You select the tool, provide necessary input (chapter IDs, instructions, target word counts), and **confirm** whether to apply the AI-generated patches (`patch-NN.xml`).
*   **Output:** Applied revisions are recorded in new `patch-NN.xml` files. `version-NN.html` and `latest.html` are updated after each confirmed patch.

**Phase 4: Binding the Pages (Finalization)**

*   **Agent Action:** Once you exit the Editing phase, `pulpgen` consolidates the `outline.xml` and all applied `patch-*.xml` files into the definitive final manuscript.
*   **Output:** Produces `final.xml` and the polished `final.html`.

## Tips for Success

1.  **A Solid Blueprint:** The richer and clearer your initial book idea, the better the foundation the AI has to build upon. Don't skimp on the concept!
2.  **Master the Editing Tools:** Phase 3 is your chance to steer the ship. Use the interactive editing options strategically. Need more depth? *Make Longer*. Plot point feels weak? *Rewrite with Instructions*. Staring at a mess? *Fresh Rewrite* might help. Unsure what's wrong? *Ask for Suggestions*. Got a specific fix? *General Edit Request*.
3.  **Embrace the First Draft:** `pulpgen` delivers a *first draft*. It's designed to rapidly get words on the page based on your directions. Expect to perform further human editing and polishing on the `final.html` or `final.xml`.
4.  **Expect Quirks:** AI, even sophisticated ones like Gemini, can sometimes introduce inconsistencies, repeat phrases, or have stylistic hiccups. Keep an eye out during the interactive editing phase and be prepared for final manual touch-ups.
5.  **Trace the Clues (Optional):** The `patch-*.xml` files and `version-*.html` files are your audit trail. If something seems off, you can examine how the story evolved step-by-step.
6.  **Iterate and Experiment:** Not thrilled with the outcome? Tweak your initial idea, refine your editing instructions in Phase 3, or even start a new `pulpgen` run. Sometimes the second attempt hits the mark!

## Optional Tinkering

*   **API Key:** Managed via `.env` file or interactive prompt (see Installation).
*   **Advanced Tweaks:** For seasoned operators, constants within `pulpgen.py` like `WRITING_MODEL_NAME` and `WRITING_MODEL_CONFIG` allow changing the underlying Gemini model or adjusting generation parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.). Proceed with caution!
